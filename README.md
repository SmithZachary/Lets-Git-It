# Lets Git It!

A basic open source project to learn how to submit pull requests, and merge them off of branches. 

## Getting Started

Clone this project, create your own branch make any changes you want that make sense and go ahead and submit that branch for a Pull Request. 

I will be writing how to how to soon...

In the mean time for help DM on twitter @spacemulecode if you have any issues or need any tips.

This is a simple skill set but until you do it once or twice it can be difficult.
